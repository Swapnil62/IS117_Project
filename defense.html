<!-- About Defense -->
<div class = "about-offense">
    <h3> Defense</h3>
    <p> The defensive team, also known as the "defense", is the team that 
        begins a play from scrimmage without possession of the ball. The objective
        of the defensive team is to prevent the other team from scoring and win
        possession of the ball for their side.
    </p>

<!-- About Defensive team-->
<div class = "about-OffensiveTeam">
    <h3> Defensive Positions</h3>

    <p><b>Defensive Tackles (DT):</b>Each team starts one or two defensive tackles
    depending on whether they are running a 3-4 or 4-3 front; defensive tackles
are some of the biggest players on the field and specialize in clogging the middle
of the field to defend against runningback, although some are also fast enough to get
to the quaterback.</p>
    <p><b>Defensive Ends (DE):</b>These players line up on either side of the defensive tackle(s) and either set the edge of the defense against the running back or work to get around the offensive tackles to put pressure on the opposing quarterback</p>
    <p><b>Outside Linebackers ILB):</b>The 3-4 defenses have two inside linebackers while 4-3 defenses have three linebackers serving a variety of roles; inside linebackers are often the leader of the defense, responsible for calling out adjustments, stopping the run game, and defending the middle of the field</p>
    <p><b>Cornerbacks (CB):</b>These players will line up against wide receivers in the passing game in either man-to-man coverage (1-on-1 against a receiver) or in a zone formation where they cover a specific part of the field</p>
    <p><b>Free Safety (FS):</b>Free safeties are often the “center fielder”; they prevent big plays from occurring and assist cornerbacks in pass coverage in the deeper third of the field</p>
    <p><b>Strong Safety (SS):</b>Strong safeties have much more versatility in where they line up on the field, contributing to the pass rush, pass coverage, and run defense; they will often line up “in the box” or with the linebackers as an extra defender closer to the line of scrimmage</p>
