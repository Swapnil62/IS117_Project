    <h3> Formations for Special Teams</h3>

    <h5>Kicking Formations</h5>
    <img src="images/kickoff.jpeg" alt="kickoff" width="80%" height="100%">
    <p>This is the formation you will see either to start the first or second half or immediately following a score by the kicking team (the black team here). Alongside the kicker will be 10 players who are known as the gunners – these players are some of the fastest runners or hardest hitters on the roster and typically won’t be heavily relied upon as starters on defense or offense. The receiving team will have two returners back on either side – in this case, WR #12 and #38. One of those returners will catch the football and attempt to run it upfield while the rest of his special teams teammates attempt to block the gunners and create space for him.</p>
   
    <h5>Field Goal Formation</h5>
    <img src="images/fieldgoal.jpeg" alt="fieldgoal" width="40%" height="50%">
    <p>If the offensive team is unable to convert by the fourth down, they will often attempt a field goal (if in range). Here, we see the kicking team lining up from about the 18-yard line to kick a field goal. This is also where the extra point or PAT is attempted from. The kicker (#4) is responsible for kicking the ball through the uprights while his teammate, the punter (#3), holds the ball for him. This can also commonly be the backup quarterback on the roster. The rest of the players on the field for the kicking team are responsible for blocking the opposing players while they attempt to get around or over the line of scrimmage to block the kick. If they successfully block the kick, they have an opportunity to run downfield with the football if they can catch it before it touches the ground.</p>
    
    <h5>Punting Formation</h5>
    <img src="images/punting.jpeg" alt="punting"width="40%" height="50%">
    <p>Punt coverage is very different from kickoff coverage, as you can see from this picture. The players are much more crowded at the line of scrimmage as this takes place as a normal offensive snap would – with players within a few feet of each other at the time of the snap. It’s rare for any players other than the punt returner to be set up downfield as the returning team will attempt to crowd the line of scrimmage to try to block the punt. The punting team will leave several players on the line of scrimmage to protect the punter and give him time to boot the ball downfield.</p>
