<!-- About Rules -->
<div class = "about-rules">
    <h3> Rules</h3>
    <p> Understanding the rules of football is one of the biggest obstacle to learning the game as beginner. The NFL has complex and very long rulebook. I'm going to explain you some of the basic rules here. </p> 
    
    <p id="rules"><b>Timing</b></p>
    <p>NFL games are played over the duration of 60 minutes total. Those 60 minutes, are broken down into four quarters of 15 minutes each. The first two quarters are played before halftime and remaining two are played after. The winner of the coin toss can determine whether it would prefer to receive the opening kickoff or "defer" to the second half.  </p>
    <p id="rules"><b>Timeouts/Play Clock</b></p>
    <p>Each team gets three timeouts per half which they can use at any point in the game during the half. Unused timeouts from the first half do not carry over to the other half. At the end of each half, there is 2-minute warning for which the clock is automatically stopped.There is also a play clock on every down which lasts 40 seconds timed from the end of previous down. </p>
    <p id="rules"><b>First Downs</b></p>
    <p>Each time the offense has the ball, they have four tries or downs to gain 10 yards. If it successfully gains 10 yards, it earns a "first down" and another set of four downs. If the offense is reaches fourth down, it will usually punt the ball away to force the opposing team to begin their drive from worse field position.</p>
    <p id="rules"><b>Turnovers</b></p>
    <p>A turnover will occur when a defender takes possession of the football away from the opposing team. This can either take place on a fumble or interception. A fumble occurs when the offensive ball carrier loses possession of the football before being tackled to the ground. An interception occurs when a defensive player catches a thrown football that the quaterback intended to be passed to an offensive teamates.</p>
    <p id="rules"><b>Overtime</b></p>
    <p>When the two competing NFL teams are tied at the end of regulation time(60 minutes) they will play a 10-minute overtime period. Before overtime, a coin toss will occur which determines which team receives the ball to start overtime. Recently, there have been change in overtime rules and will be implemented in the 2022 season.</p>
